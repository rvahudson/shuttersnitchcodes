ShutterSnitch Code Replacements for Photojournalists

I know a lot of us are doing a lot of political reporting right now, so I'm compiling code replacement lists for politicians and other common topics that can be used in ShutterSnitch. I'm sure they can also be adapted to Photo Mechanic, CaptureOne, etc. if you know what you're doing.

I shoot for ZUMA, so the names for individuals are in ALL CAPS, with abbreviations in AP style. If you want to contribute, please keep with these conventions.

Regardless, I hope someone besides myself finds these useful!
