ShutterSnitch Code Replacements for Photohournalists

I know a lot of us are doing a lot of political reporting right now, so I'm compling code replacement lists for politicians that can be used in ShutterSnitch. I'm sure they can also be adapted to Photo Mechanic, CaptureOne, etc. if you know what you're doing.

I shoot for ZUMA, so the names for individuals are in ALL CAPS, with abbreviations in AP style. If you want to contribute, please keep with these conventions.

Regardless, I hope someone besides myself finds these useful!
